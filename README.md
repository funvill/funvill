## 👋 Hi there, I'm Steven Smethurst (also sometimes Funvill)

I live two lives. 
During the day I am a CTO at [Chipkin Automation Systems](http://store.chipkin.com/) (@chipkin) making devices talk to each other, and at night I am a [Artist, Maker, Hardware Hacker](https://blog.abluestar.com/cv/)

If I’m not beep booping at my day job, I might be 🌳 [visting every park in Vancouver BC](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2020-vancouver-parks/), or making a deck of cards with 📸🐦 [photos of birds](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2021-bird-playing-cards/), or I am working on one of my many side [Projects](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/). See what I am [currently working on](https://blog.abluestar.com/now)

My interests bounce around to whatever catches my attention. [PCB Design](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2022-monthly-habit-tracker/), Paper craft, 🪟 [Stained Glass](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2018-stained-glass-window/), 🗺️ Maps, 🎲 [Boardgames](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2023-skull-game-pcb/), [Segment Displays](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2019-illuminated-stained-glass-sixteen-segment-display/), [Lasers and kaleidoscopes](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2017-laser-kaleidoscope/) and anything that glows.

I been writing in my [blog](https://blog.abluestar.com/blog/) since 2001 and I use [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/funvill/) to post in progress update of my current projects. 

Feel free to reach out and say hi
